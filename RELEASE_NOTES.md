# Release notes

[EmojiKit](https://github.com/danielsaidi/EmojiKit) tries to honor semantic versioning:

* Deprecations can happen in any version.
* Deprecations are only removed in `major` updates.
* Breaking changes should only occur in `major` updates.
* Breaking changes *can* occur in `minor` & `patch` updates, if needed.



## 2.3.1

This version fixes a category selection bug where the internal state was triggered when externally setting a category.



## 2.3

This version improves the grid performance and adds more bindings and styling options to both grids.

You can now pass in a `category` binding to be able to scroll to a certain category, and use it to observe the currently visible category. To improve grid performance and make grid selection more reliable, the `selection` binding is now required. 

Some old init parameters have been deprecated and no longer works, so make sure to address all warnings to avoid any faulty behavior. The deprecated logic will be removed in the next major version. 

In the notes below, `EmojiGridScrollView` has the same design changes as `EmojiGrid`.

### ✨ Features

* `Collection<EmojiCategory>` has a new `.standardGrid` value.
* `EmojiGrid` has a new `category` binding and makes the `selection` mandatory.
* `EmojiGrid` has a new `scrollViewProxy` property injected by the scroll view.
* `Emoji.SkintonePopover` has a new `.emojiSkintonePopoverStyle` view modifier.
* `Emoji.SkintonePopoverStyle` can be used to set the visual style of a popover.
* `ScrollViewProxy` has new scroll capabilities.

### 💡 Changes

* `EmojiGrid` has a much better performance than before.
* `EmojiGrid` renames and removes some initializer parameters.
* `EmojiGrid` by default adds emojis to `.frequent` and `.recent`.
* `EmojiGrid` now only *picks* and emojis on taps, and doesn't *select*.
* `EmojiScrollGrid` has moved all its scroll proxy logic to `EmojiGrid`.

### 🗑️ Deprecations

* `EmojiGrid` no longer takes `emojis` - modify `categories` instead.
* `EmojiGrid` no longer takes `categoryEmojis` - modify `categories` instead.
